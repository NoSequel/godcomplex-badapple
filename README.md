# Instructions
* Drop the plugin into the /plugins folder
* Create a `GodComplex-BadApple/video` folder, inside of there put the contents of the `split-zip.zip` and `split-zip-2.zip` file on the repository.

# NOTE
* There are approximately 6000 `.png` files within the `split-zip.zip` and `split-zip-2.zip` archives combined, these are split using ffmpeg.
* There are 2 `split-zip` archives to bypass github's 100 MB file limit (LFS didn't work, guess github hates me.)
